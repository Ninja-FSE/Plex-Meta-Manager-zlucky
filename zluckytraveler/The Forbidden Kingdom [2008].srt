1
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:06,736
Have some tea.
It'll help you to recover.

2
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,975
Old lady found you
lying in the river.

3
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:57,576
We all thought you were dead.

4
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:19,250
Let's go! Let's go!

5
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,851
Running away?
Help me!

6
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:28,552
Please let her go!

7
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,201
Quick, go and grab hold
of that guy!

8
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,843
Stop, stop!

9
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,835
Drop what you are holding!

10
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,136
Try to run and I'll kill you.
Come here!

11
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:11,337
What is that you are holding?
Where are you from?

12
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:18,426
Drop the staff if you want your life.

13
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:24,060
Please Sirs, some money
to this poor drunkard.

14
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,882
Get lost!

15
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,788
Where did you get that staff?

16
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:06,117
Where did you find it?

17
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:56,213
Cheers!

18
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:18,000
Old wife.

19
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:20,754
Where did this come from?
From them.

20
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:24,120
Officers, look what they're using to pay.
What is this?

21
00:32:45,837 --> 00:32:47,828
My Lord

22
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,831
How dare you...
can't you see I am busy?

23
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:54,835
The devine staff of legend...

24
00:32:54,846 --> 00:32:57,838
It was seen in the Middle Kingdom...

25
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:58,838
Impossible.

26
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:03,844
The villagers are beginning to
whisper of prophecy...

27
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:08,849
Mortals are always whispering of prophecy.

28
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:11,852
It's their opium.

29
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,860
What other offending news
do you have for me?

30
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,864
That is all, My Lord.

31
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:35,876
Summon the Witch...
The one born of wolves.

32
00:33:45,897 --> 00:33:47,888
Where were we?

33
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:19,399
He's not even Chinese.

34
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,402
We are all the same inside,
Aren't we Monk?

35
00:42:22,413 --> 00:42:23,402
Heaven help us.

36
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:27,407
What, you find it a sin?

37
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:30,410
Yes, it is sinful not to share.

38
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:32,411
Cheers!

39
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:29,468
An old man and a boy,
They had tea here, Yes?

40
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:32,471
A Soldier Monk rides with them...
Who else?

41
00:43:33,483 --> 00:43:35,474
I do not know
who you speak of...

42
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:53,493
Men are such liars.

43
00:44:07,518 --> 00:44:08,507
Sparrow...

44
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,509
Sparrow...

45
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:14,514
...where do you nest?

46
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,000
Horse Stance!

47
00:51:25,555 --> 00:51:26,544
It is them.

48
00:51:26,556 --> 00:51:28,547
They're headed towards the desert.

49
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:32,551
They are between me and the River of Sand.

50
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:35,554
Isn't it just like King Monkey...

51
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:39,558
...summoning a boy to do a man's job?

52
01:17:59,987 --> 01:18:01,976
Cheers!

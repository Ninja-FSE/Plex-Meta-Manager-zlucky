1
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,528
What's going on, Hop?

2
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:44,698
You back again?

3
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,496
Oh, sick!

4
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,498
Find good one?

5
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,742
<i>Yeah, Ten Tigers of Kwangtung.</i>

6
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:56,544
This is gold.

7
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:00,706
<i>Bride With White Hair.</i>

8
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,166
Chinese, no subtitles.

9
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,460
Hey, Hop, do you have
any early Shaw Brothers?

10
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:05,794
There's a guy
who does Leopard style ...

11
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,889
Leopard style, Dragon style ...

12
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,893
fly through air, fight on water.

13
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:17,022
Crouching Tiger,
Spanking Monkey.

14
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,140
I know you.

15
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,402
Another white boy
who wants to know kung-fu.

16
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,404
Kick the ass.

17
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,656
Get the girls.

18
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,287
Only storage back here.

19
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,073
Where did you get this?

20
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,833
It was here ...

21
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:21,420
when my grandfather
opened this shop ...

22
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,380
hundred years ago.

23
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,302
He waited for a man
to come to pick it up ...

24
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:31,847
return to rightful owner.

25
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:35,434
Man never came.

26
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,512
My father take over the shop.

27
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:41,265
Waited, too. Long time.

28
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,067
Now me.

29
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,945
That's a Northern Temple-style
bo staff.

30
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,731
Same kind the thirteen monks used
to save the Tang Emperor.

31
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:50,824
I've seen it before.

32
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,026
That exact one.

33
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,528
I've had dreams about it.

34
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,330
You know why?

35
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:58,365
<i>You watch
too much Hong Kong Phooey.</i>

36
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,700
Come.

37
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,502
Come on.

38
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:05,840
I give you
five awesome Bruce Lee movie ...

39
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,208
for very sick price.

40
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,594
You're the man, Hop.

41
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,775
Jason!

42
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,269
Hey. What's up?

43
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,563
Not much.
Just, you know, cruisin'.

44
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:30,773
You been down to Chinatown.

45
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,700
What's up with that?

46
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,443
Kung-fu.

47
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:35,486
Are you serious?

48
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,987
I'm not supposed
to talk about it ...

49
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:38,405
not under the kung-fu code.

50
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:42,618
Hey, look. The new kid's
makin' time with the hoodsies.

51
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:44,995
J-boy, you still riding
this loser cruiser?

52
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:47,506
You need to get a motor
for this shit.

53
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:49,166
What we got here?

54
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,168
Just some bootlegs, no big deal.

55
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,137
<i>"Enter the Dragon"?</i>

56
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:55,005
<i>"The Bride With White Hair"?</i>

57
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,683
Yeah, that's actually very good.

58
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,928
Come on, let him go.

59
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,805
Yeah, don't. He knows kung-fu.

60
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:04,098
What?

61
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,349
You think you're Chinese?

62
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,902
You hangin' out
with them Chinks in C-town?

63
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,937
What's up with you?
Let's see some, man.

64
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:11,522
Come on.

65
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,023
Let's see some kung-fu, huh?

66
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,825
Kung-fu master.

67
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,370
Want some tae kwon do, huh?

68
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,076
Yo, Lupo.

69
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:26,879
He's hangin' out with that
old Chink cashes checks.

70
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,260
You in tight with the old man?

71
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,016
Just shut up and do it!

72
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,731
It's late, man.
He's probably gone home.

73
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:53,939
He's not here. Let's just go.

74
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,950
Who's there?

75
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,577
Kung-fu boy.

76
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:01,455
You back
for more good-price movie?

77
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,498
I told you,
best deal in Chinatown.

78
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,467
Come in.

79
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,637
Want some tea?

80
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,265
Red Sox game is on.

81
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,227
Yankees winning. Very bad.

82
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,682
Who's with you?

83
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:29,767
Friend?

84
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,027
Where you keep the cash?

85
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,234
I said,
where do you keep the cash?

86
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:41,495
-Please ...
-Come on, old man!

87
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,290
Stay here!

88
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,560
Found your Xbox.

89
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:11,984
Hop!

90
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:13,268
Jesus, Lupo!

91
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,728
-What the hell, man?
-You shot him!

92
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,530
Take it.

93
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,900
Must return to rightful owner.

94
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:21,744
Run.

95
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,830
You didn't see that, yo.

96
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:27,208
You didn't see that!

97
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,803
Come here, you little shit!

98
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,889
Lupo, come on, man! Just don't ...

99
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,433
-You didn't see nothing!
-Calm down, Lupo.

100
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,600
Hey, chill, man. Come on.

101
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:54,935
-Put the gun down.
-Shut up!

102
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:58,355
Maybe I pulled the trigger,
but we're all in this together!

103
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,283
But this little cockroach,
he ain't one of us!

104
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,892
Excuse me.

105
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:18,811
I don't know where I am.

106
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,354
I don't know how I got here.

107
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:22,615
I remember falling.

108
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,567
What? This?

109
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:50,369
You want this?

110
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,751
I don't know what you're saying.

111
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:44,381
I can't understand you!

112
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,637
That's because
you're not listening!

113
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,224
Behind you!

114
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,425
I don't know where I am ...

115
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:29,877
or how I got here ...

116
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:32,179
and who those guys were
that wanted to kill me.

117
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:34,214
But whatever you did back there
was sick.

118
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:37,476
No. Drunken Fist.

119
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,479
Secret kung-fu of the South.

120
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:44,066
I'm Lu Yan, traveling scholar.

121
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,643
What land do you come from, monk?

122
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,696
I'm not a monk.

123
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,230
I'm Jason.

124
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:53,367
Jason Tripitikas,
from South Boston.

125
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,070
Is this a dream?

126
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,780
No.

127
00:15:57,781 --> 00:16:00,741
Where you came from
is the dream ...

128
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,460
through the Gate of No Gate.

129
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:06,455
Is that like a wormhole
or something?

130
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:09,717
No. It means
you are either a Zen master ...

131
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,753
or you carry something
very special.

132
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,171
This?

133
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:16,465
It was in a pawn shop, waiting
for a man to pick it up ...

134
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:20,728
and return it
to its rightful owner.

135
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,063
What?

136
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,566
It's long been foretold ...

137
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,068
that a seeker will come ...

138
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:33,440
to return the staff and end
the reign of the Jade Warlord.

139
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,576
Return the staff to who?

140
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,444
The Monkey King.

141
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,780
Born of a stone ...

142
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:43,000
on the mountain of fruit
and flowers.

143
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:48,163
With his weapon in hand,
his chi became like fire ...

144
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,791
his stick fighting like magic.

145
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,469
He defied the order
of the land ...

146
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,097
but the Jade Army
could not defeat him.

147
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:20,946
The Monkey King crushed
every soldier sent to stop him.

148
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:24,750
With his magical staff,
he was unbeatable.

149
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,827
Word of his disobedience ...

150
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,788
traveled deep
within the Forbidden Kingdom ...

151
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:34,134
to the Five Elements Mountain,
land of the immortals.

152
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,587
Once every 500 years ...

153
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,339
the Jade Emperor hosts
the Peach Banquet.

154
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,134
It is here,
the heavenly ministers gather ...

155
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,344
to celebrate their longevity ...

156
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:47,481
and drink
the elixir of immortality.

157
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:53,062
One sip of this heavenly brew
will give everlasting life ...

158
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:56,532
free from mortal suffering
and desire.

159
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:04,165
Into the banquet, the
Monkey King crashed, uninvited.

160
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:12,173
The Jade Emperor was
enchanted by the Monkey King.

161
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:15,551
But the Jade Warlord
was not amused.

162
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,336
As master of the army ...

163
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:21,307
the Warlord demanded
the Monkey King bow down to him.

164
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,611
He's a bit unrefined,
that's all.

165
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:38,824
Give the naughty monkey
a title and let him go.

166
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,447
Satisfied all was well
in heaven and earth ...

167
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:47,074
the supremely high Emperor ...

168
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,952
left to begin
his 500 years meditation ...

169
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:54,548
leaving the Jade Warlord
in charge by mandate of heaven.

170
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,917
But rather than obey
the Jade Emperor's command ...

171
00:18:56,918 --> 00:19:00,721
the Warlord challenged
the Monkey King to a duel.

172
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:05,801
High atop Five Elements Mountain
in the Warlord's palace ...

173
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:08,429
the battle of immortals
was fought ...

174
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,733
to prove once and for all
whose skills were supreme.

175
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:54,344
Most excellent stick fighting,
Sun Wukong.

176
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:58,482
But without your weapon, you're
nothing but a lowly hermit!

177
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,444
No more weapons,
no more chi magic.

178
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:06,240
Fist against fist.

179
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,901
The Monkey King
was too trusting ...

180
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:10,903
and believed
the Warlord's words ...

181
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,330
laying down his magic weapon.

182
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:23,290
Realizing he'd been tricked, the
Monkey King cast the staff ...

183
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,509
out into the Middle Kingdom.

184
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:46,614
Martial art
is based on deception ...

185
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:49,033
my friend.

186
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,700
Being immortal, the Monkey King
could not be killed ...

187
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,451
only trapped in stone ...

188
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,787
where he waits for the seeker
from the prophesy ...

189
00:23:01,788 --> 00:23:06,091
to return to him his great weapon
and finally free him.

190
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:18,854
That's what I heard, anyway.

191
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,890
Long time ago.

192
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:23,859
How long has he been imprisoned?

193
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,905
Five hundred years,
give or take a few decades.

194
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:30,607
They say
when the Monkey King is free ...

195
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,785
the Jade Emperor will return.

196
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,446
How do I get home?

197
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:39,700
You must return the staff
to Five Elements Mountain.

198
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,785
You must free the Monkey King.

199
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,162
I can't free the Monkey King.

200
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:44,204
I gotta get home.

201
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,707
Innkeeper! More wine.

202
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,301
Jeez, don't you think
you've had one too many?

203
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,087
Wine is my inspiration.

204
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:54,965
In some parts,
I am known as the Poet.

205
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,767
<i>Gambei.</i>

206
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,898
In other parts,
I am known as the Beggar.

207
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:26,914
What do we do now?

208
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,966
How good is your kung-fu?

209
00:24:30,377 --> 00:24:32,044
He who speaks does not know.

210
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,254
He who knows does not speak.

211
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,599
Surely, you are masterful.

212
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:43,931
Where did you get that weapon?

213
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:44,932
It's a fake.

214
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,935
You can find anything these days
on the Silk Road.

215
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,987
Out of way, old fool.

216
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,742
Hand it over.

217
00:24:56,486 --> 00:25:00,247
Hand over the weapon ... or die.

218
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,011
Go!

219
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:48,587
Lu, help!

220
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:08,724
Protect yourself!

221
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,526
What?

222
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,518
Let's go!

223
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,285
Where are you going?

224
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:46,280
-Jump!
-I don't think so!

225
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,541
Don't think! Just do!

226
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,344
Come on!

227
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,689
Thank you!

228
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:20,731
Such skills, child!

229
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,691
Are you
from northern mountains?

230
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:25,452
She is Golden Sparrow,
from the south.

231
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,835
You really saved
our lives back there.

232
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:23,877
I don't know
what we would have done ...

233
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:24,920
if you hadn't come along.

234
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:29,141
She does not think The Drunken
Immortal needed his life saved.

235
00:29:29,718 --> 00:29:31,477
You're immortal?

236
00:29:31,928 --> 00:29:33,971
What do you run from, child?

237
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,223
Bounty hunters
trying to stop her ...

238
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:39,485
from reaching
the Five Elements Mountain.

239
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:47,192
I suggest
you keep riding west ...

240
00:29:47,193 --> 00:29:49,403
and only stop
to water your horses.

241
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:50,571
You're not coming?

242
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,573
The journey
to Five Elements Mountain ...

243
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,283
crosses barrens and deserts.

244
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:55,576
Unspeakable dangers.

245
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:57,411
Worst of all, no wine.

246
00:29:57,412 --> 00:29:58,746
His elixir.

247
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:00,247
Every immortal has one.

248
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:02,708
I'm very sorry.
Without wine, I would perish.

249
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:04,501
You must understand this.

250
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,379
No. You must understand this.

251
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,181
This is insane!

252
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:12,226
-You wish to get home?
-Yes.

253
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,220
Then listen well!

254
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:16,263
If you die here ...

255
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:18,974
you'll be found dead
in the world you left behind.

256
00:30:18,975 --> 00:30:20,818
Do you understand?

257
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,980
My jug is getting low.

258
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:27,116
I must say goodbye. Bye-bye.

259
00:30:35,742 --> 00:30:37,242
Lu.

260
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,786
Wait!

261
00:30:38,787 --> 00:30:39,912
Let him go.

262
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:43,716
You are the one
to return the staff, not him.

263
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:45,959
How good is your kung-fu?

264
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,753
He's got no kung-fu.

265
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:49,129
None!

266
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,839
Lu, wait!

267
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,800
Teach me.

268
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,102
Teach me to fight!

269
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:05,854
Swing soft, cut hard!

270
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:07,865
At the same time!

271
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,659
He's terrible.

272
00:31:14,698 --> 00:31:17,241
I've been your weed-whacker
for two days now ...

273
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,910
while you sit on your horse
like the King of England.

274
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,328
When are you gonna
teach me kung-fu?

275
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:24,715
-You want to learn kung-fu?
-Yeah.

276
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:30,471
I teach you kung-fu.

277
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:34,216
That's called strike.

278
00:31:34,217 --> 00:31:36,051
Tomorrow, I'll teach you block.

279
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:37,937
Let's go.

280
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:41,607
Swing soft, cut hard.

281
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,630
You think you'll teach me
the No Shadow Kick?

282
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:08,551
And the Buddha Palm Technique?

283
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:12,713
<i>There's a guy
in Virtual Fighter 2 ...</i>

284
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:14,214
that does
the Buddha Palm technique.

285
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:15,674
Thanks, Lu.

286
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:17,768
And he does the ...

287
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,271
the Iron Elbow ...

288
00:32:20,513 --> 00:32:22,806
and he does
the One-Fingered Death Touch.

289
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,932
The cup's full.

290
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,901
Stop! It's full.

291
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,479
Exactly.

292
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,323
How can you fill your cup
if already full?

293
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:33,233
How can you learn kung-fu?

294
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:35,652
You already know so much.

295
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,247
No Shadow Kick, Buddha Palm!

296
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,583
Empty your cup.

297
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:46,997
Hopeless.

298
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,924
It is hopeless.

299
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:12,114
It is said that music ...

300
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:17,077
is a bridge
between earth and heaven.

301
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,497
It's beautiful.

302
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:28,047
It belonged to her mother.

303
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:33,255
Lu Yan?

304
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:51,899
Sparrow!

305
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:37,811
Are you all right?

306
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:38,854
Jason, what happened?

307
00:36:38,855 --> 00:36:41,740
He took it! The staff!

308
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:46,287
The Jade Warlord
has sent a bounty hunter.

309
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:48,455
We are doomed.

310
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,876
That's his horse.

311
00:37:00,877 --> 00:37:02,678
He must be inside.

312
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:05,672
Why would he take refuge
in a temple?

313
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,674
That's what I intend
to find out.

314
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:09,602
Wait with the horses.

315
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,676
Good to get off my feet.

316
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:45,513
Long day.

317
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,215
So, where are you from?

318
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,226
Shandong Province?

319
00:37:51,052 --> 00:37:53,804
You look like
the Shandong Province type.

320
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,814
You come here often?

321
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,319
That staff
doesn't belong to you.

322
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:06,492
You have to give it to me,
or somebody might get hurt.

323
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:28,574
What kind of monk are you?

324
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,577
Stealing from travelers.

325
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,582
A silent one, I see.

326
00:39:37,492 --> 00:39:39,293
Or deaf.

327
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:43,130
I'm speaking to you, monk!

328
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,389
Praying Mantis.

329
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,723
Very good ...

330
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:26,308
for catching bugs.

331
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,360
But not tiger!

332
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:27,221
You tried to steal the staff
for the Warlord!

333
00:43:27,222 --> 00:43:29,106
No, fool!

334
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:34,445
I'm on a mission to find
the seeker of the staff.

335
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:55,049
You found him.

336
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:13,586
How long have you been searching
for the staff?

337
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,088
As long as I can remember.

338
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,446
Jason, go deeper!

339
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:32,906
Must taste bitter before sweet.

340
00:46:32,907 --> 00:46:35,334
Horse stance. Grow roots.

341
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:49,014
Horse stance.

342
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:53,561
Very good ... for taking a dump.

343
00:46:56,056 --> 00:46:57,306
Enough from you!

344
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,641
He's my student, not yours!

345
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:02,895
Two tigers cannot live
on the same mountain.

346
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:06,073
Two masters cannot teach
the same student!

347
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:13,447
If he is really to learn
the kung-fu ...

348
00:47:13,448 --> 00:47:16,867
he must develop speed,
accuracy, and power.

349
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:19,370
Hey! I know that.

350
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:21,163
It's the Way
of the Intercepting Fist.

351
00:47:21,164 --> 00:47:22,965
Bruce Lee?

352
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:31,048
I will punch.

353
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,383
You block.

354
00:47:32,384 --> 00:47:34,185
Ready?

355
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:39,648
What did I teach you
about the Snake?

356
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:42,151
Now you punch me.

357
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,030
See?

358
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:49,316
Again. You punch him again.

359
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:51,118
Snake!

360
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:55,239
He's not ready for Snake.

361
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,074
Perhaps Eagle.

362
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,502
Crane! Crane!

363
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,173
Stop!

364
00:48:13,174 --> 00:48:14,633
I've had enough!

365
00:48:14,634 --> 00:48:16,051
No more!

366
00:48:16,052 --> 00:48:18,521
No more silent riddles!

367
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:20,981
And no more empty cups!

368
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:28,280
First, you show respect
to your teachers!

369
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,495
So, what about the two tigers
on one mountain?

370
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,957
We can kill each other
when it's over.

371
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:49,501
Kung-fu.

372
00:48:49,502 --> 00:48:52,972
Hard work over time
to accomplish skill.

373
00:48:57,385 --> 00:48:59,887
A painter can have kung-fu.

374
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:04,224
Or the butcher who cuts meat
every day with such skill ...

375
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:07,361
his knife never touches bone.

376
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:15,035
Learn the form,
but seek the formless.

377
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:17,363
Hear the soundless.

378
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:21,241
Learn it all,
then forget it all.

379
00:49:21,242 --> 00:49:26,172
Learn The Way,
then find your own way.

380
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:28,665
The musician can have kung-fu ...

381
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,710
or the poet who paints pictures
with words ...

382
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:33,796
and makes emperors weep.

383
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:36,390
This, too, is kung-fu.

384
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:40,928
But do not name it, my friend,
for it is like water.

385
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:43,347
Nothing is softer than water ...

386
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:46,225
yet it can overcome rock.

387
00:49:46,226 --> 00:49:48,018
It does not fight.

388
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:51,021
It flows around the opponent.

389
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:52,940
Formless, nameless ...

390
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:56,443
the true master dwells within.

391
00:49:56,444 --> 00:49:59,330
Only you can free him.

392
00:51:02,177 --> 00:51:05,396
Behold the tyranny
of the Warlord.

393
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,848
He must be stopped.

394
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:12,111
He must be killed for his crimes
and his head put on a post.

395
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:17,116
But we must not feel hatred
towards him, or he wins.

396
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:21,996
If he speaks of compassion
for this devil ...

397
00:51:22,238 --> 00:51:25,124
he should go back to his temple
and pray.

398
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,619
Our mission is not one of peace.

399
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,422
Go back
to your mother and father.

400
00:51:31,706 --> 00:51:33,841
You are but a child.

401
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:35,843
They are dead.

402
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:40,014
And she's not a child.

403
00:51:41,591 --> 00:51:43,642
Not anymore.

404
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:47,229
Her father ...

405
00:51:47,389 --> 00:51:51,942
was a government official
who opposed the Warlord.

406
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:55,938
And so, to set an example ...

407
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:59,825
the Warlord dispatched
his troops into the night.

408
00:52:04,197 --> 00:52:08,575
Legion upon legion poured out
of the Five Elements Mountain ...

409
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:11,754
into the lowlands
of the Middle Kingdom.

410
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:17,343
Screams of innocent people
hung in the night air.

411
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:25,059
When it was over, charred ruins
were all that remained.

412
00:52:25,427 --> 00:52:30,231
That, and a lonely child, hidden
in the well by her mother ...

413
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:33,442
ruthlessly murdered
by an arrow ...

414
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:38,239
from the Warlord's bow.

415
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:46,872
When she reaches
the Warlord's palace ...

416
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:51,085
she will
not offer him forgiveness ...

417
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,295
monk.

418
00:52:53,455 --> 00:52:55,548
She will offer him ...

419
00:52:55,582 --> 00:52:57,466
this ...

420
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:04,715
a jade dart ...

421
00:53:04,716 --> 00:53:07,726
that can kill an immortal.

422
00:53:08,303 --> 00:53:11,313
Long has she practiced.

423
00:53:15,769 --> 00:53:19,780
Vengeance has a way
of rebounding upon oneself.

424
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:27,454
Master of sensitivity.

425
00:54:10,198 --> 00:54:11,657
Damn.

426
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:13,584
This desert is hot.

427
00:54:14,828 --> 00:54:17,004
This is not a desert.

428
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:20,049
That is the desert!

429
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:26,463
I hope you know
where you're going!

430
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,307
Crazy monk.

431
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:47,303
A monk on a mission.

432
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,962
And where does he lead us?

433
00:55:48,963 --> 00:55:51,807
Across a desert to nowhere.

434
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:19,585
We're not going to make it,
are we?

435
00:56:23,248 --> 00:56:26,258
And even if we do, we still
have to face the Jade Army.

436
00:56:29,129 --> 00:56:31,305
What if I can't handle it?

437
00:56:37,137 --> 00:56:38,979
What if I freeze?

438
00:56:43,685 --> 00:56:46,028
Don't forget to breathe.

439
00:57:19,137 --> 00:57:23,774
If we don't find water soon,
we will perish.

440
00:57:25,143 --> 00:57:29,697
Perhaps a Taoist immortal
can make rain.

441
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:35,369
If he truly is
a Taoist immortal.

442
00:59:00,488 --> 00:59:02,823
You are an insult
to the name of Buddha!

443
00:59:02,824 --> 00:59:04,667
Blasphemy!

444
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:09,296
Look!

445
00:59:10,123 --> 00:59:12,550
I lead you to the mountain!

446
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:15,970
Out there!

447
01:00:24,823 --> 01:00:26,624
Can you see them ...

448
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:28,792
in the clouds?

449
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,253
A two-headed lion.

450
01:00:31,913 --> 01:00:33,580
Right there.

451
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:35,341
See?

452
01:00:36,084 --> 01:00:37,843
Yeah, I see.

453
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:40,254
See that one?

454
01:00:40,255 --> 01:00:42,306
Right there,
coming up behind it?

455
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,391
Like a wave?

456
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:47,436
Looks like the Green Monster.

457
01:00:47,762 --> 01:00:49,638
Green monster?

458
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:51,524
You mean dragon.

459
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:54,276
No, I mean Fenway Park.

460
01:00:54,644 --> 01:00:57,404
They call the left field fence
the Green Monster.

461
01:00:58,064 --> 01:01:00,074
It's true.

462
01:01:02,444 --> 01:01:05,079
It does kind of look like
a dragon, though, doesn't it?

463
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,838
Have you family
back in this land you come from?

464
01:01:15,415 --> 01:01:17,216
My mother.

465
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,343
Father?

466
01:01:20,295 --> 01:01:22,179
Never knew him.

467
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:26,183
Do you ever long for him?

468
01:01:27,635 --> 01:01:29,854
Wonder who he was?

469
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:36,152
Maybe the only thing
I've ever been good at ...

470
01:01:37,479 --> 01:01:39,405
pretending that I don't.

471
01:01:42,025 --> 01:01:44,076
She is sorry.

472
01:01:48,073 --> 01:01:50,916
How romantic.

473
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:55,537
Men will tell you
what you want to hear, Sparrow.

474
01:01:55,538 --> 01:02:00,092
But in the end, they will
leave you with nothing.

475
01:02:03,338 --> 01:02:05,506
You survived the River of Sand.

476
01:02:05,507 --> 01:02:07,508
Impressive.

477
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:09,343
And you, boy ...

478
01:02:09,344 --> 01:02:11,011
so far from home.

479
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:14,181
I can ensure your safe return.

480
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:16,183
Just bring the weapon forward.

481
01:02:16,184 --> 01:02:18,319
I don't think so.

482
01:02:18,687 --> 01:02:20,779
Why do you want the staff?

483
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,982
When I deliver
the lost weapon ...

484
01:02:23,983 --> 01:02:28,662
the Jade Warlord shall grant me
the Elixir of Immortality.

485
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:32,783
An orphan girl,
a lost traveler ...

486
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:36,036
an old drunk,
and a monk who has failed ...

487
01:02:36,037 --> 01:02:39,173
at the same task
for half his life.

488
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:45,930
Misfits following a misfit
in hopes of rescuing ... a misfit.

489
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:08,869
Kill them.

490
01:05:07,605 --> 01:05:09,898
Lu! You okay?

491
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:11,992
Just thirsty.

492
01:05:34,299 --> 01:05:36,717
It's okay. He's immortal, right?

493
01:05:36,718 --> 01:05:37,801
I mean, he is, right?

494
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:39,553
Wine. He needs his wine!

495
01:05:39,554 --> 01:05:41,055
There is nothing we can do.

496
01:05:41,056 --> 01:05:42,097
What are you saying?

497
01:05:42,098 --> 01:05:43,983
We have to do something!

498
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:20,427
I'm afraid the wound
is too deep.

499
01:06:20,428 --> 01:06:23,230
He will not survive it.

500
01:06:23,598 --> 01:06:25,483
He needs wine.

501
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:28,268
He's one of the Eight Immortals.

502
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:30,696
Wine is his elixir. Please.

503
01:06:32,232 --> 01:06:34,867
We will send a walking monk.

504
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,786
Don't you have a running monk?

505
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:01,894
When I was your age ...

506
01:07:02,262 --> 01:07:05,439
I was a scholar-warrior
in training.

507
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:09,652
My arrow was good.
So, too, my kung-fu.

508
01:07:10,145 --> 01:07:16,116
So I was chosen to take
the civil examinations.

509
01:07:16,776 --> 01:07:19,370
To pass would place me ...

510
01:07:20,155 --> 01:07:24,291
in the very short line
of scholar immortals.

511
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:28,754
I failed.

512
01:07:30,373 --> 01:07:32,383
You're not an immortal?

513
01:07:34,794 --> 01:07:38,088
If one
does not attach himself ...

514
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:40,599
to people and desires ...

515
01:07:42,302 --> 01:07:45,563
never shall his heart be broken.

516
01:07:47,015 --> 01:07:48,816
But then ...

517
01:07:50,018 --> 01:07:52,611
does he ever truly live?

518
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,908
I would rather die a mortal ...

519
01:07:59,402 --> 01:08:01,871
who has cared about someone ...

520
01:08:03,156 --> 01:08:05,366
than a man free ...

521
01:08:05,367 --> 01:08:07,668
from his own death.

522
01:08:09,037 --> 01:08:11,463
I don't want to lose you.

523
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:16,677
Forget about me.

524
01:08:18,922 --> 01:08:22,174
There is only one
Elixir of Immortality.

525
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:25,386
It is
the Emperor's mix of jade ...

526
01:08:25,387 --> 01:08:28,314
cinnabar, and salts of mercury.

527
01:08:28,556 --> 01:08:32,985
It is forever stored in
the realm of the Jade Palace ...

528
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,023
high in the Jade Firmament,
rarely touched by mortals.

529
01:08:38,024 --> 01:08:41,652
To reach it,
one must take the north road ...

530
01:08:41,653 --> 01:08:45,080
and cross the border
of heaven and earth ...

531
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:49,084
only to face the Jade Army.

532
01:08:50,578 --> 01:08:52,379
I'm sorry.

533
01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:55,257
There is no other way.

534
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,968
Yes, there is.

535
01:08:58,753 --> 01:09:01,380
In two nights,
there should be no moon.

536
01:09:01,381 --> 01:09:04,258
We can take the south side
of the fourth peak ...

537
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:06,685
under cover of darkness.

538
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,230
-We have to go now.
-No!

539
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:11,357
But he's going to die!

540
01:09:12,308 --> 01:09:14,693
We go now, we all die.

541
01:09:18,648 --> 01:09:22,827
There is more at stake,
an entire kingdom.

542
01:09:25,905 --> 01:09:28,374
Your passage home.

543
01:09:30,452 --> 01:09:34,621
We will advance in two nights,
when the moon has ceased.

544
01:09:34,622 --> 01:09:36,549
So be it!

545
01:10:23,046 --> 01:10:24,930
When she met you ...

546
01:10:25,173 --> 01:10:28,976
long ago in a tea house ...

547
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:32,062
you were a lost boy
and frightened.

548
01:10:34,849 --> 01:10:37,818
Not the kind
she would stand and fight with.

549
01:12:32,717 --> 01:12:36,061
You've made
a most excellent judgment.

550
01:12:53,154 --> 01:12:55,956
The seeker from the prophecy.

551
01:12:56,324 --> 01:12:58,534
Not quite what I expected.

552
01:12:58,535 --> 01:13:02,796
A man is dying
back on Song Mountain.

553
01:13:02,831 --> 01:13:04,590
I need the Elixir.

554
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:08,168
And why should I give it to you?

555
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:10,554
Because I brought you the staff.

556
01:13:11,172 --> 01:13:15,100
The life of your friend
for the power to rule a kingdom?

557
01:13:15,468 --> 01:13:18,103
A most reasonable offer.

558
01:13:18,263 --> 01:13:21,941
This man, a good friend?

559
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,934
And a good teacher.

560
01:13:23,935 --> 01:13:27,947
The man who honors his teacher
honors himself.

561
01:13:28,481 --> 01:13:34,028
However, there is a bit
of a problem with your request.

562
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:35,863
You see ...

563
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:39,742
I've promised the Elixir
to someone else.

564
01:13:39,743 --> 01:13:41,702
But she
didn't bring you the staff.

565
01:13:41,703 --> 01:13:43,462
I did.

566
01:13:43,538 --> 01:13:45,965
The boy has a point.

567
01:13:48,376 --> 01:13:51,804
My Liege, you made a promise.

568
01:13:51,921 --> 01:13:55,766
There is but one way
to resolve such matters.

569
01:13:55,925 --> 01:13:59,812
A martial challenge ...
to the death.

570
01:14:01,848 --> 01:14:03,816
With pleasure.

571
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:22,835
The Elixir of Immortality.

572
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:30,509
The prize goes to the winner.

573
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,281
Enough!

574
01:17:12,747 --> 01:17:15,382
The seeker from the prophecy.

575
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:18,135
I find that quite amusing.

576
01:17:18,837 --> 01:17:23,057
Did you really think, even for
a minute, you stood a chance?

577
01:17:25,802 --> 01:17:28,229
I didn't think so.

578
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:27,529
She will kill you, witch!

579
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:31,083
Not if I kill you first,
orphan bitch!

580
01:21:21,663 --> 01:21:23,422
<i>Gambei!</i>

581
01:21:42,475 --> 01:21:44,443
Remember what I taught you!

582
01:22:41,785 --> 01:22:43,669
The statue!

583
01:22:47,582 --> 01:22:49,467
Use the staff!

584
01:24:32,687 --> 01:24:34,446
My turn!

585
01:26:17,834 --> 01:26:19,635
My Lord.

586
01:26:20,003 --> 01:26:21,420
Who are you?

587
01:26:21,421 --> 01:26:25,141
The youngest daughter
of a family you murdered.

588
01:26:26,217 --> 01:26:28,936
Come drink with me.

589
01:26:48,323 --> 01:26:50,749
No!

590
01:26:53,828 --> 01:26:55,629
Sparrow!

591
01:26:57,332 --> 01:26:59,083
Come on.

592
01:26:59,084 --> 01:27:01,927
Come on.
You're going to be okay.

593
01:28:32,761 --> 01:28:35,020
Jade Warlord?

594
01:28:35,722 --> 01:28:37,481
He's dead.

595
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,036
I thank you.

596
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,634
Is there anything you can do?

597
01:29:48,378 --> 01:29:52,431
Her destiny was written
by her own hand.

598
01:29:53,383 --> 01:29:55,726
I am sorry.

599
01:30:29,419 --> 01:30:31,303
Traveler ...

600
01:30:31,713 --> 01:30:34,214
you have come far,
through the Gate of No Gate ...

601
01:30:34,215 --> 01:30:37,885
to fulfill the prophecy
of the mortals.

602
01:30:37,886 --> 01:30:41,188
What do you desire, please?

603
01:30:42,223 --> 01:30:44,441
I just want to go home.

604
01:30:45,935 --> 01:30:47,987
Very well.

605
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:55,703
It is said master and student ...

606
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:57,863
walk the path side-by-side.

607
01:30:57,864 --> 01:31:02,001
They share their destiny until
their paths go separate ways.

608
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,426
I'll never forget you.

609
01:31:10,585 --> 01:31:14,221
I guess that's what being
immortal truly means.

610
01:31:19,135 --> 01:31:21,687
You freed me, traveler.

611
01:31:22,305 --> 01:31:25,649
Now go free yourself.

612
01:33:10,538 --> 01:33:13,632
So what's it gonna be?

613
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:19,763
You gonna shut up?

614
01:33:27,222 --> 01:33:28,514
Listen, pissant!

615
01:33:28,515 --> 01:33:30,983
I ain't gonna ask you again!

616
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:45,789
Come on, maggot, get up!
Come on!

617
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,459
You want some more?

618
01:33:50,078 --> 01:33:51,879
Come on.

619
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:31,377
We don't have to do this.

620
01:35:05,987 --> 01:35:07,863
Take it easy, sir.

621
01:35:07,864 --> 01:35:08,947
You're gonna be fine.

622
01:35:08,948 --> 01:35:11,158
Hop! Hop!

623
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:12,326
How's he doin'?

624
01:35:12,327 --> 01:35:14,628
It missed his heart.
He'll live.

625
01:35:16,247 --> 01:35:18,540
Of course I'll live.

626
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:20,885
I'm immortal.

627
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:26,307
Did you return the staff
to rightful owner?

628
01:35:27,008 --> 01:35:28,767
I did.

629
01:35:29,469 --> 01:35:31,604
You're the man.

630
01:36:10,552 --> 01:36:12,520
Is he gonna be all right?

631
01:36:15,223 --> 01:36:17,141
Looks like it.

632
01:36:17,142 --> 01:36:18,642
I saw what happened.

633
01:36:18,643 --> 01:36:20,736
I work across the street.

634
01:36:21,229 --> 01:36:23,364
You were very brave.

635
01:36:25,567 --> 01:36:27,368
See ya.

636
01:36:30,447 --> 01:36:32,414
Absolutely.

637
01:36:46,671 --> 01:36:48,797
And so the legend is told ...

638
01:36:48,798 --> 01:36:51,717
that the Monkey King
began his journey west ...

639
01:36:51,718 --> 01:36:53,894
in search of truth ...

640
01:36:54,095 --> 01:36:56,638
while the traveler
returned to his world ...

641
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:01,527
to walk the path of the warrior
and find his own truth.

642
01:37:01,603 --> 01:37:03,696
As one tale ends ...

643
01:37:04,147 --> 01:37:06,532
so another begins.

1
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:36,416
Have some tea.
It'll help you to recover.

2
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:25,674
Old lady found you
lying in the river.

3
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:29,429
We all thought you were dead.

4
00:12:49,346 --> 00:12:52,029
Let's go! Let's go!

5
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:54,741
Running away?
Help me!

6
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:01,729
Please let her go!

7
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,748
Quick, go and grab hold
of that guy!

8
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,973
Stop, stop!

9
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:29,135
Drop what you are holding!

10
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,706
Try to run and I'll kill you.
Come here!

11
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:46,343
What is that you are holding?
Where are you from?

12
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,735
Drop the staff if you want your life.

13
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:59,558
Please Sirs, some money
to this poor drunkard.

14
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:01,509
Get lost!

15
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:35,107
Where did you get that staff?

16
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:40,564
Where did you find it?

17
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:18,937
Old wife.

18
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:21,809
Where did this come from?
From them.

19
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,628
Officers, look what
they're using to pay.

20
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:25,267
What is this?

21
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,124
My lord

22
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:17,211
How dare you...
Cant you see I am busy ?

23
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,892
The devine staff of legend...

24
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,019
It was seen in the middle kingdom...

25
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,084
Impossible

26
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:29,985
The villagers are beginning to
whisper of prophecy...

27
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:35,199
Mortals are always whispering of prophecy.

28
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,953
It's their opium

29
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:46,043
What other offending news
do you have for me?

30
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,716
That is all, my Lord.

31
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,478
Summon the witch...
The one born of wolves.

32
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:16,950
Where were we?

33
00:44:07,749 --> 00:44:09,313
He's not even Chinese.

34
00:44:09,626 --> 00:44:12,024
We are all the same inside,
Aren't we Monk?

35
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:13,901
Heaven help us.

36
00:44:16,007 --> 00:44:17,571
What, you find it a sin?

37
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:20,804
Yes, it is sinful not to share.

38
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:22,639
Cheers!

39
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,679
An old man and a boy,
They had tea here, Yes?

40
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:24,870
A Soldier Monk rides with them
Who else?

41
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:27,706
I do not know
who you speak of...

42
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:47,060
Men are such liars.

43
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:03,389
Sparrow...

44
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:05,495
Sparrow...

45
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:09,833
...where do you nest?

46
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,214
It is them.

47
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:41,174
They're headed towards the desert.

48
00:53:41,842 --> 00:53:45,345
They are between me and the River of Sand.

49
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:49,078
Isn't it just like King Monkey...

50
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:53,896
...summoning a boy to do a man's job?

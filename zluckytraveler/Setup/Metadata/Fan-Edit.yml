    summary: The original 160-minute 'Theatrical Cut' of 'Amadeus' that won multiple Oscars and BAFTAs in 1984 only exists on an old poor quality 1998 PAL "flipper" DVD (and Laserdisc and VHS). Every release since then (including all blu-rays) has been the 180-minute 'Director's Cut'. I simply wanted to cut the DC blu-ray to match the TC DVD, so I have both cuts as an option.

    summary: There is a new opening recap to the ending of Part 1 and a subsequent scene not seen in Part 1. The tone is less cartoonish, more balanced, and there is a lot of new music with deleted material used to flesh out the movie. Much like Part 1 the focus is on Peter and Gwen's relationship without all the other distractions.

    summary: "An epic two-in-one edit of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Seamlessly combining the two films, along with credits scenes from Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel.

    summary: "Batman: The Man Who Laughs tries to amplify the strengths of The Dark Knight while omitting some of its weaknesses. Pacing is tightened up, some scenes are restructured, rescored, reordered, or omitted altogether. Lines of dialogue and humor that seemed out of place omitted as well. I usually fanedit awful movies. Here I wanted to take a very good movie and make it the best it could be."

    summary: The main problem with 'Blade Runner 2049' was the insanely slow pace of the editing/cutting. Every line had a vast gap after it and every shot lingered for too long, even if nothing whatsoever was happening in the shot and the camera was motionless. I love long movies but when a film is nearly 3-hours, careless and lax editing is a crime. It's like they assembled all the footage and forgot to go through and tighten everything up like a good editor should. So I was interested in making a cut of this film that focused (almost) entirely on improving the pace of the cuts. The same film/experience but edited properly. An experiment in doing a fanedit that doesn't actually remove anything!

    label: FanFix
    summary: This edit includes various visual and audio elements from all released versions of Blade Runner in an attempt to make it the best available presentation with a few narrative edits for personal preference. Most notable inclusions are the technical updates from The Final Cut, with the visual elements re-graded to match the legacy colour tones of the previous releases - and particular attention being paid to literally preserving the original portions of the legacy frames as well as grading the changes where masking was appropriate. The film's narrative follows more closely the Workprint and tacitly rejects Ridley Scott's attempts to render the human/replicant philosophical analogue as effectively superficial. This version takes out any connection to references made by Scott in interviews and indeed the Director's Cut relating to Deckard's origins. Instead this film is content to literally study/contrast the philosophical state of all the humanity on display or lack thereof from all participants.

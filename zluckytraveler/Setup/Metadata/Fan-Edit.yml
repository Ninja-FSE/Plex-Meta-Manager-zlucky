    summary: The original 160-minute 'Theatrical Cut' of 'Amadeus' that won multiple Oscars and BAFTAs in 1984 only exists on an old poor quality 1998 PAL "flipper" DVD (and Laserdisc and VHS). Every release since then (including all blu-rays) has been the 180-minute 'Director's Cut'. I simply wanted to cut the DC blu-ray to match the TC DVD, so I have both cuts as an option.

    summary: This is The Amazing Spider-Man with all its deleted scenes PLUS the Roosevelt subplot from the second movie added to the first movie. This is the full extent of the promised Untold Story without polluting the overstuffed second movie.

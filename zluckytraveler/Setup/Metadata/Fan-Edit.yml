    summary: The original 160-minute 'Theatrical Cut' of 'Amadeus' that won multiple Oscars and BAFTAs in 1984 only exists on an old poor quality 1998 PAL "flipper" DVD (and Laserdisc and VHS). Every release since then (including all blu-rays) has been the 180-minute 'Director's Cut'. I simply wanted to cut the DC blu-ray to match the TC DVD, so I have both cuts as an option.

    summary: Scenes were cut, that are out of character and using alternate and deleted material from the movie to give it a different feel. It also has rescored scenes with different music to recontextualize or emphasize different moments in the movie.

    genre.remove: Science Fiction
    label: FanFix
    summary: There is a new opening recap to the ending of Part 1 and a subsequent scene not seen in Part 1. The tone is less cartoonish, more balanced, and there is a lot of new music with deleted material used to flesh out the movie. Much like Part 1 the focus is on Peter and Gwen's relationship without all the other distractions.

    label: FanFix
    summary: "An epic two-in-one edit of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Seamlessly combining the two films, along with credits scenes from Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel. Additionally, there has been much cut from both films to remove some of the crappy dialogue and humour, to make for the most digestible and tolerable rewatch experience."

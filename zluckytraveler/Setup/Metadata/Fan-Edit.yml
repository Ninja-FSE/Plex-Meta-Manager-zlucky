    summary: The original 160-minute 'Theatrical Cut' of 'Amadeus' that won multiple Oscars and BAFTAs in 1984 only exists on an old poor quality 1998 PAL "flipper" DVD (and Laserdisc and VHS). Every release since then (including all blu-rays) has been the 180-minute 'Director's Cut'. I simply wanted to cut the DC blu-ray to match the TC DVD, so I have both cuts as an option.

    summary: The main problem with 'Blade Runner 2049' was the insanely slow pace of the editing/cutting. Every line had a vast gap after it and every shot lingered for too long, even if nothing whatsoever was happening in the shot and the camera was motionless. I love long movies but when a film is nearly 3-hours, careless and lax editing is a crime. It's like they assembled all the footage and forgot to go through and tighten everything up like a good editor should. So I was interested in making a cut of this film that focused (almost) entirely on improving the pace of the cuts. The same film/experience but edited properly. An experiment in doing a fanedit that doesn't actually remove anything!

    label: FanFix
    summary: This edit includes various visual and audio elements from all released versions of Blade Runner in an attempt to make it the best available presentation with a few narrative edits for personal preference. Most notable inclusions are the technical updates from The Final Cut, with the visual elements re-graded to match the legacy colour tones of the previous releases - and particular attention being paid to literally preserving the original portions of the legacy frames as well as grading the changes where masking was appropriate. The film's narrative follows more closely the Workprint and tacitly rejects Ridley Scott's attempts to render the human/replicant philosophical analogue as effectively superficial. This version takes out any connection to references made by Scott in interviews and indeed the Director's Cut relating to Deckard's origins. Instead this film is content to literally study/contrast the philosophical state of all the humanity on display or lack thereof from all participants.

    summary: This fanedit is my love letter to John Carpenter's classic horror film "The Thing" but also to that beautiful decade that was the 80s. There are many, many movie and pop culture references throughout; there's a new soundtrack, alternate dialog, new visual effects (some so subtle only the most hardcore The Thing fans will notice) and more Easter eggs than Palmer's got dutchies. Basically, I threw everything but the kitchen sink at this Thing.

    summary: The year is 1940. As Hitler’s forces storm across Europe, Winston Churchill is elected the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His leadership is immediately tested when hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops become trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, with the Germans closing in. As the desperate battle for survival unfolds on land, sea and air, Churchill must fight his own battles to launch a daring rescue effort across the English Channel. This fan edit combines the intense frontline action of Dunkirk with the backroom political intrigue of Darkest Hour, to create an epic supercut that tells the full story of the Dunkirk evacuation

    label: FanFix
    summary: The theatrical cut was full of lines which were very on the nose. Additionally, there was a subplot, involving Motoko's mother, that went nowhere. These issues have been addressed in the Lean & Mean cut. Moreover the beginning of the movie was re-edited to mimic the way the original animated movie starts. To this purpose, the credits scene was rescored using Kenji Kaway new rendition of the original main theme. Scenes from the very beginning of the movie have been used to create a flashback sequence that now appears much later. Multiple scenes where shortened, lines of dialogues were either deleted or altered or used in different contexts. The cemetery scene was restored to its original state and purpose. As far as I can tell, in the theatrical cut it was sliced in 2 to accomodate for the character of Motoko's mother, which I presumed was added at a later time to address the whitewashing controversy and to make up for the deleted scenes which included the character of Paz.

    summary: Over half of the cumulative running time of the films have been cut. What was once a bloated, 542-minute trilogy is now a more digestible 247-minute epic. In general, I’ve tried to keep the spirit of the book intact by removing unnecessary subplots, characters, ridiculous action scenes, and so on.

    summary: Going to see Crystal Skull on opening night is probably the worst cinematic experience I've ever had. You could just feel the room deflate, all the energy disappear, the excitement turned to disappointment. I hated it. However, time has been kinder than expected to the film. Maybe it's comparing it to what passes for modern "adventure" filmmaking, but it's sort of outdated style kind of works in its favor. There's a lot of things that do work about it. Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast are game. Though it's kind of a "left hand" movie from Spielberg, he's still the greatest movie director of our lifetimes, so it's still got some great visuals and action. The story could be intriguing.

    label: FanFix
    summary: This edit aims to eradicate the paternal cause of some questionable narrative that essentially removed the viewer from the fantasy of adventure and also other complaints I had with the level of schlock falling lower than was necessary. It also aims to strike a balance for those that didn’t mind or could live with certain things like cgi bugs or iconic atomic silhouettes... Cutting the best part of twenty minutes was as far as I’d like to go to try to keep a feature length feel. There be aliens ahead, but differently presented...

    summary: Die Another Day should have been celebration of everything good about the James Bond franchise. Unfortunately, in trying to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the screen in celebration of 007's 40th anniversary, director Lee Tamahori and the producers ended up with an unfocused movie, riddled with poor innuendo jokes and some ill-advised ventures into the more fantasy CGI arena. The hope with Icarus, is to redress the balance and uncover what I believe is a genuinely good old-fashioned large scale Bond adventure. No invisible car, no CGI tsunami surfing heroics, the poor jokes removed, Icarus attempts to give Pierce Brosnan the Bond swansong he deserved.

    summary: "Star Wars: Revisited represents perhaps the boldest and most sophisticated of any of the fan edits of Star Wars EP IV: ANH. Star Wars: Revisited not only fixes errors and technical limitations to the film that should have been made in the first SE, but gives us a whole new vision for the movie, tying it to the rest of the Star Wars saga while correcting many of the excesses of the original SE. Shots are re-mastered and restored, special effect shots are re-composited and whole new sequences are created, giving the viewer a taste of what the SE could have been."

    summary: "In 2008, a relatively unknown Faneditor going by the name of Adywan shook the Fanediting galaxy with his release of 'Star Wars: Revisited'. From that day, Faneditors and film enthusiasts from around the world (and we'd like to think throughout the galaxy…) have waited in eager anticipation for the continuation of Adywan's Revisited saga. That day has arrived! Prepare yourself to relive the magic of Star Wars with Adywan's 'The Empire Strikes Back Revisited'."

    label: FanFix
    summary: The first of the revamped '9000 series', Cloak of Deception delivers a re-crafted perspective on Star Wars Episode I in keeping with the drive of the original trilogy of films. Unnecessary 'galaxy shrinking' cameos from classic characters have been cut down or removed. Anakin is depicted as a more mature and capable figure an audience can identify with. Jar Jar is recast as an everyman caught up in events outside his control who does his part in the fight for freedom, rather than a traitorous clown.

    summary: The second of the revamped '9000 Series,' The Approaching Storm delivers a re-crafted perspective on Star Wars Episode II in keeping with the drive of the original trilogy of films. Unnecessary 'galaxy shrinking' cameos from classic characters have been cut-down or removed. Anakin and Padme are depicted as realistic adults developing romantic feelings for one another. The political plot is made more straightforward and graspable. Superfluous action is subdued to make the film more story driven.

    summary: The third of the revamped '9000 Series,' Labyrinth Of Evil delivers a re-crafted perspective on Star Wars Episode III in keeping with the drive of the original trilogy of films. Anakin's fall to the dark side is portrayed in a more believable way, with political motivations that are ignited by, rather than preceded by, a desire to save his wife. Padme's role is expanded, and her fate is made to match her daughter's memories.

    summary: "It's the same Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens you fell in love with, only restructured slightly so that Starkiller Base does not fire until close to the end of the film. During the battle over Starkiller Base, the stakes are no longer protecting the Resistance base, but preventing the destruction of the Republic Capitol. Even though they destroy the First Order's superweapon, they fail to do so in time to save the day."

    summary: "It’s the same Star Wars: The Last Jedi you pondered over, cleared of distractions. The trip to the casino of Canto Bight is truncated, the Caretakers of Ach-To are removed, and a few scenes are rearranged, allowing Rian Johnson’s story to shine. Strap in for a contemplative journey not experienced since The Empire Strikes Back."

    summary: "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker gets an overhaul to serve as a conclusion to the Star Wars saga. Pacing, character journeys, and story continuity are improved via an unprecedented fan editing collaboration. A layer of polish and care applied to a relentlessly fast-paced film. Subtle character tweaks. And a few new surprises."

    label: FanFix
    summary: Rise of the Rebellion is a light fanfix of what I consider to be the second best Star Wars movie currently released. This edit differs from others in that it does not drastically reduce the length, narrative focus of the movie or add any John Williams cues. Rise of the Rebellion seeks to restore heroes to the movie by slightly shifting their motivations and actions to produce a story that is filled with brave heroes and less distractions.

    label: FanFix
    summary: In typical fashion, exposition gets cut drastically. The last time something is explained, is hopefully the only time it is. My intent is to leave some mystery and suspense, and not everyone needs to be a main character. I didn't know these characters besides Harley before watching, and that is the perspective I maintain. Slipknot is simply a plot device, not a main character.

    summary: This is a serious take on TERMINATOR 3 to be more in the tradition of its prequels. Lots of cheesy and unnecessary elements were removed as well as all the references to dates and ages that contradict the previous two films.

    label: FanFix
    summary: Thor Love and Thunder arrived in cinemas to the sounds of raucus laughter, and the sound of footsteps as people walked out of the cinema, disgusted at what a blundering fool Thor had become. Whilst many people enjoyed Taika Waititi's unique blend of humour and emotion, There are many people who felt he had taken it too far. Thor Love and Thunder Minus Comedy takes the worst of the comedy out and aims to focus on Thor's emotional journey, rediscovering love and accentuating the threatening presence of Gorr the god-butcher. Thor discovers that Gorr is aiming to kill all gods and sets out on a mission to raise an army to rescue the abducted children of Asgard. It's not yet clear how this army will come about but on the way, he meets the enigmatic Zeus whose allegiances are never quite clear, and rekindles a romance with Jane Foster who has her own secrets.

    label: FanFix
    summary: Tron Perfection is a story about the conflict of man vs himself, and less about Sam Flynn (who is merely our entry-point into the Grid.) Kevin Flynn spent so much in his crusade to get revenge on Dillinger in the original Tron that once he got his revenge, made Clu, and set about to create a new Grid, he was mirroring comparable character flaws that included massive ambition married to a sense of entitlement.

    summary: This is a “grindhouse” version of George Lucas’s Star Wars (Episode 4 'A New Hope'). Some of the deleted scenes, alternate takes and behind the scene footage are now back in the movie. New music. New special effects. Key scenes have been reorganized.

    label: FanMix
    summary: "This is a sequel to THE WAR OF THE STARS: A NEW HOPE GRINDHOUSED, released in 2010. The goal is now to mix “The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the Jedi” while taking care of the changes made for the first edit. A lot of deleted scenes are also back in this edit. Some hopefully intertaining twists and more than 90 new special effects turn this project into something that I think is special even if maybe not as “fun” as the first edit. Or fun in another kind of way."

    summary: This edit takes the HD transfer on the 'Ultimate Director's Cut' blu-ray and goes in and fixes, alters, or replaces every single changed shot to "Reconstruct" the original 'Theatrical Cut' in almost the same HD quality. So we can once again enjoy the film the way it was meant to be seen 1979, without compromising on visual quality.

    summary: Diana kept fighting after the events of her first movie in smaller, more hidden humanitarian ways, even though she gave up hope in mankind as a whole. We do not find her in the 80s anti-social and still brooding about Steve this whole time. Instead she is a confident hidden hero, who happens upon a chance that brings him back, and she realizes AGAIN how much she lost. This movie becomes the reason she still thinks about him in the present day JL movies. She was over him in that she knew he was gone the first time, only to have him come back for a while and let him go again. She essentially gets PTSD from this experience, instead of just being lovesick for the full 100 years. (Also, Steve is not inhabiting anyone else’s body in this edit.) WW84 also should have dialed up the 80's soundtrack. Bill and Teds was shot in '87 and released in '89, so I already knew I couldn't lock myself into ‘84 if I wanted to mix the soundtracks. Bill and ted's gave me tons of source material to work with, but I needed more, so since Bill and Ted wanted to work with Van Halen, Van Halen leads the additional songs needed. There is also Judas Priest, Pat Benatar, The Expressions, Killing Joke, Vangelis, Oingo Boingo, Def Leppard, Scorpions, Harold Faltermayer and Kenny Loggins.

    summary: The original 160-minute 'Theatrical Cut' of 'Amadeus' that won multiple Oscars and BAFTAs in 1984 only exists on an old poor quality 1998 PAL "flipper" DVD (and Laserdisc and VHS). Every release since then (including all blu-rays) has been the 180-minute 'Director's Cut'. I simply wanted to cut the DC blu-ray to match the TC DVD, so I have both cuts as an option.

    summary: This is The Amazing Spider-Man with all its deleted scenes PLUS the Roosevelt subplot from the second movie added to the first movie. This is the full extent of the promised Untold Story without polluting the overstuffed second movie.

Inspired by SamSpider3â€™s own extended cut, this adds all-new deleted and extended scenes with finished VFX being masterfully reintegrated into the movie. adding 10 new scenes and 11 more minutes of footage.

    summary: "An epic two-in-one edit of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Seamlessly combining the two films, along with credits scenes from Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel. Additionally, there has been much cut from both films to remove some of the crappy dialogue and humour, to make for the most digestible and tolerable rewatch experience."

All deleted and extended scenes have been masterfully reintegrated into the movie. adding 10 new scenes and 8 more minutes of footage.

    label: FanFix
    summary: "Batman: The Man Who Laughs tries to amplify the strengths of The Dark Knight while omitting some of its weaknesses. Pacing is tightened up, some scenes are restructured, rescored, reordered, or omitted altogether. Lines of dialogue and humor that seemed out of place omitted as well. I usually fanedit awful movies. Here I wanted to take a very good movie and make it the best it could be."

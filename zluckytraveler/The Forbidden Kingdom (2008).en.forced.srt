1
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:06,736
Have some tea.
It'll help you to recover.

2
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,975
Old lady found you
lying in the river.

3
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:57,576
We all thought you were dead.

4
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:19,250
Let's go! Let's go!

5
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,851
Running away?
Help me!

6
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:28,552
Please let her go!

7
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,201
Quick, go and grab hold
of that guy!

8
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,843
Stop, stop!

9
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,835
Drop what you are holding!

10
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:01,136
Try to run and I'll kill you.
Come here!

11
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:11,337
What is that you are holding?
Where are you from?

12
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:18,426
Drop the staff if you want your life.

13
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:24,011
Please Sirs, some money
to this poor drunkard.

14
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,882
Get lost!

15
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,788
Where did you get that staff?

16
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:06,117
Where did you find it?

17
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:18,000
Old wife.

18
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:20,754
Where did this come from?
From them.

19
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,458
Officers, look what
they're using to pay.

20
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:24,071
What is this?

21
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,830
My lord

22
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,750
How dare you...
Cant you see I am busy ?

23
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
The devine staff of legend...

24
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,320
It was seen in the middle kingdom...

25
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,300
Impossible

26
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,000
The villagers are beginning to
whisper of prophecy...

27
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,000
Mortals are always whispering of prophecy.

28
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,600
It's their opium

29
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,400
What other offending news
do you have for me?

30
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,840
That is all, my Lord.

31
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Summon the witch...
The one born of wolves.

32
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Where were we?

33
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,580
He's not even Chinese.

34
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,180
We are all the same inside,
Aren't we Monk?

35
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,980
Heaven help us.

36
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,500
What, you find it a sin?

37
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Yes, it is sinful not to share.

38
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Cheers!

39
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,980
An old man and a boy,
They had tea here, Yes?

40
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,040
A Soldier Monk rides with them
Who else?

41
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
I do not know
who you speak of...

42
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,320
Men are such liars.

43
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,980
Sparrow...

44
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,000
Sparrow...

45
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
...where do you nest?

46
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
It is them.

47
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,000
They're headed towards the desert.

48
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,000
They are between me and the River of Sand.

49
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,580
Isn't it just like King Monkey...

50
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,200
...summoning a boy to do a man's job?
